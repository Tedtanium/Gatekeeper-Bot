# Gatekeeper-Bot

This bot will manage automation of basic server functions, interfacing and accepting commands from Discord.

### To-do: 
- Reshuffle things -> core.py | 3 cogs: serveractions.py, ticker.py, moodupdater.py | gatekeeper/management.py
- Bugfixes: What if a user stops the server before it goes up fully? More what-ifs that may break process. 
- Polish step: Only allow commands if done in a specific channel. 
- Polish step: Only print to console on state change (e.g. server status Down -> Starting -> Up, possibly with time taken inbetween?
- Create user documentation for the project.
