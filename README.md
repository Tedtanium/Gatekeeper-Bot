# Gatekeeper-Bot

This bot will manage automation of basic server functions, interfacing and accepting commands from Discord.

### To-do: 
- Bugfixes: What if a user stops the server before it goes up fully? More what-ifs that may break process. 
- Feature: Add ability for players to force world saves on the server. 
- Polish step: Only allow commands if done in a specific channel. 
- Create user documentation for the project.
